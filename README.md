# RG-350-M-Unified-Save-folder
This script aims to create a single place where all the emulators are saving their saves and states.

This scripts is used to move all the supported emulator save files and states into a single folder in your SD card and maintain them there by smilinking the needed folders inside a single one (see default directories).
#The SD Card must be renamed into RG-350, otherwise you have to fix the script.

**Default directories**
- roms: /media/RG-350/roms
- saves/states: /media/RG-350/saves
